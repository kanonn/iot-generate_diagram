方案一：专业且全面（推荐，显得你非常有条理）
Hi Sudharsan-san,

Following your guidance on the missing components and the 40% change rule, I have raised a new provisioning ticket (the 3rd application) which now includes:

S3 logger and AWSMC

Verified target group and listener configurations (updated to port 80/443 mapping)

All necessary ECS parameters for completeness

Could you please cancel/ignore the first two applications and proceed with this latest one? This consolidated ticket reflects the final architecture.

Thanks for your detailed review!


既然你已经在第三次申请里补齐了，你可以这样解释，化解他觉得“参数少”的顾虑：

"Hi Sudharsan-san,

Regarding the ECS parameters, since we are utilizing AWS Fargate, many infrastructure-level settings are managed by AWS. However, I have now explicitly defined all essential Task-level parameters in the 3rd ticket to ensure completeness:

Task CPU/Memory and Operating System/Architecture.

Desired Task Count and Deployment configuration.

Integrated the S3 logger and AWSMC as requested.

This latest ticket provides a comprehensive view of the Fargate configuration."
