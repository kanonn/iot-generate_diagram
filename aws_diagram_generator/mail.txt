方案一：专业且以项目进度为导向（最推荐）
这种表达强调了 ANEMS 测试 的紧迫性，并给出了明确的后续计划，能够打消他对“架构不完整”的顾虑。

Hi Sudharsan-san,

Regarding the printer configuration, the client PM is still coordinating the exact network location and IP address.

To avoid delaying the high-priority ANEMS testing, I propose to decouple the printer setup from the current ticket:

Phase 1 (Current Ticket): Proceed with all approved components (Fargate, S3 logger, AWSMC) to start ANEMS testing immediately.

Phase 2 (Future Update): Once the PM confirms the printer details, I will raise a separate delta ticket to add the VGW and specific security group rules.

This approach ensures that we meet the tight deadline for ANEMS operations. Does this plan align with your requirements?
