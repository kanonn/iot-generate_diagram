Subject: Confirmation of PoC Environment Configuration for Project [AB_CDE]

Hi Sudharsan-san,

As discussed in our recent meeting/chat, I am writing to formally confirm the following configuration details for the ANEMS API verification environment (Project: AB_CDE):

Scope & Duration: This is a short-lived PoC environment intended for internal verification only. The planned duration is no more than 4 weeks.

Authentication: Due to the absence of a Cognito App Client and the urgent timeline for ANEMS testing, we have decided to exclude Cognito authentication for this phase.

Network Security: The environment is strictly restricted to the internal network (Intranet/Private VPC). There is no public internet exposure, which minimizes the security risk of bypassing Cognito for this temporary period.

Production Commitment: We fully acknowledge that this setup is only for PoC. For the future production environment, we will strictly adhere to the company's security standards and implement full Cognito integration.

Ticket Reference: All these details, along with the S3 logger, AWSMC, and Aurora PostgreSQL configurations, are reflected in the latest (3rd) provisioning ticket.

Please proceed with the approval so we can start the verification as scheduled.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
