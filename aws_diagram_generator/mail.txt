Subject: DevOps Access Request: Bitbucket & Jenkins for PoC Technical Verification - [Your Full Name]

Dear DevOps Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to request access to Bitbucket and Jenkins to support the ongoing PoC (Proof of Concept) environment for technical verification, as coordinated with the AWS implementation team.

According to the recent project status, these accesses are required to proceed with the provisioning activities. Specifically, I would like to request access for:

User Account: [你的 Nissan 登录 ID/用户名]

Employee ID: [你的员工号]

Required Access Level: Read and Execute (to view/trigger provisioning jobs and review CDK code)

Target Tools: Bitbucket and Jenkins

Could you please let me know if there are any specific forms or approval workflows I need to complete on my end?

Thank you for your support in enabling these tools for the project.

Best regards,

YUPENG [你的姓]
