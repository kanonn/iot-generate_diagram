选项 A：坚持 443（显得你很 Hardcore、守规矩）
"Regarding the 443 port: Yes, I confirm that the ALB Listener should use HTTPS (443) for client-to-ALB communication. Please help us provision/apply the necessary SSL certificate via ACM. This is a requirement for our internal security standard. ASAP, thanks!"


ALB Type: Please set the ALB to Internal. It will not be accessed from the public internet.

没问题，既然你已经决定采用 “1个Listener + 2个TargetGroup + 统一80端口” 的精简方案，我帮你把这段意思翻译成了地道、专业的职场英语。

这种表达方式既能解释清楚之前的误会，又能体现你作为 AWS 认证架构师 的专业逻辑。

"Hi [Name], thanks for the feedback. To clarify the confusion regarding the architecture:

1. Regarding the Services: There are indeed two separate Fargate services in my design. The misunderstanding might have occurred because both are standardized to use HTTP Port 80. Since they are independent services with different health check paths, we definitely require two separate Target Groups.

2. Regarding the Listener: We only need one Listener (HTTPS 443), but it needs two Listener Rules for path-based routing:

Priority Rule: Path /api/* -> Forward to TargetGroup-Backend (Port 80).

Default Rule: Path /* -> Forward to TargetGroup-Frontend (Port 80).

Please proceed with this configuration. Let me know if you need any further details. ASAP, thanks!"
