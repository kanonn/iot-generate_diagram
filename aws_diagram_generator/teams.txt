Hi Hikaru-san,

To clarify my previous message: "10.2.90.54:23" meant IP 10.2.90.54 and Port 23. It was not a typo for a /23 network range.

However, I do need to know the correct subnet CIDR for this IP. Could you please provide the correct network range (e.g., 10.2.90.0/24) that contains 10.2.90.54?

Regards,
