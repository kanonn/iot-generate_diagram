Since this is a private internal environment, we are comfortable proceeding without Cognito for this specific verification.

This setup is only for a temporary period (max 4 weeks) to test the ANEMS API. To avoid further delays, let’s disregard the Cognito component and focus on the ALB/Fargate provisioning in the latest (3rd) ticket.

Thanks for your understanding!
