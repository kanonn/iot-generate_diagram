Thank you for the suggestion, but using /* for Cognito is not suitable for our current phase.

Technical Limitation: Without a Cognito App Client, we cannot complete the "Authenticate" action configuration anyway.

Testing Impact: Using /* would force authentication on all traffic, which will block our ANEMS API verification.

To ensure completeness for our immediate testing needs, please disregard Cognito entirely for this ticket and keep the rules as "Direct Forward" for all paths.
