📝 Inquiry Description (咨询内容)
Subject: [URGENT] Request for Subnet CIDR Information - Project Deadline Imminent

Description:
I am writing to request the CIDR subnet range for the following IP address in our target environment:

Target IP Address: [这里填入你的打印机IP]

We need this information to finalize the network routing and firewall configurations for a printer setup. We have already coordinated with several internal technical teams, but they lack the necessary permissions for this specific environment and have directed us to your department for assistance.

🚨 Reason for Urgency (紧急理由)
This request is time-critical for the following reasons:

Project Deadline: This overall project is scheduled for completion and handover next month.

Environment Provisioning: We are currently in the final phase of environment setup. To remain on track with the project timeline, we are required to complete all environment-related applications by the end of this week.

Dependency: Without the CIDR information, the network configuration cannot be finalized, which will cause a significant delay in the overall project delivery.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could prioritize this request and provide the CIDR range (e.g., /24 or /23) as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support.
