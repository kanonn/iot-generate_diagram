方案二：亲切协作型（适合平时沟通较多的 Slack/Teams）
如果你和这位印度工程师聊得还不错，可以用这种更有温度的表达。

"Appreciate you looking into that! It seems we're both in the dark for now. 😂"

"No worries—I’ll take the lead to contact another team who might have the network details. I'll get back to you once I have the CIDR information. Talk soon!"


如果你是直接找对方团队的某个人私聊，语气可以更自然一点。

"Hi [对方名字], sorry to bother you. I'm working on a printer setup using IP [这里填IP]. We need the CIDR range for this subnet to finalize the routing/firewall settings."

"The [第一个团队名] team suggested checking with you. Could you please help us look up the CIDR info for this specific IP address?"

"Appreciate your help!"
